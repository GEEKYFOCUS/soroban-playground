/**
 * Domain model for the in-app Git engine (issue #1727 / FE-27).
 *
 * The playground keeps a *lightweight* Git repository in memory: a map of
 * branches, a map of commits (each commit owns an immutable snapshot of the
 * project files) and a mutable working tree that mirrors the editor buffer.
 *
 * Everything in this module is plain data — the reducer-style operations live
 * in `repository.ts` so they can be unit tested without React or the DOM.
